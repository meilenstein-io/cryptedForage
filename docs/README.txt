# cryptedForage Docs #

cryptedForage is a handy JavaScript library that improves the offline experience
of your web app by using asynchronous storage (via IndexedDB or WebSQL where
available) but with a simple, `localStorage`-like API.

These are the API docs for
[cryptedForage](http://cryptedForage.github.io/cryptedForage). You can browse the
code in the [master branch](https://github.com/cryptedForage/cryptedForage).
